# Emergent Facilitation Mastery (EFM) - Product Spec

## Product Overview
**Emergent Facilitation Mastery** is Facilitator.com's flagship online facilitation training program. It teaches the Emergent Collaboration System (ECS), a proprietary facilitation methodology built over 14 years of running workshops for companies like Google, LEGO, and P&G.

The course content is based on the live Full Stack Facilitator (FSF) Palo Alto 2025 event, adapted for self-paced online learning with studio-recorded intros/outros added for context.

**Status:** Pre-launch, targeting launch in the coming weeks.

## Relationship to Other Products

### Workshopper Master (WM)
- WM is being retired as a standalone product
- WM content is included inside EFM as bonus/legacy content
- The facilitator.com/workshopper-master page will redirect to EFM
- Existing WM students get automatic access to EFM (grandfathered in)
- EFM is mostly NEW content based on FSF Palo Alto 2025, not a rebrand of WM

### Free Facilitator Club (Skool)
- 9,700+ members in free community
- Completely separate Skool group from Pro community
- Serves as top-of-funnel / awareness for EFM

### Full Stack Facilitator (FSF) In-Person
- Premium in-person event (5 days, ~$8,400 ticket)
- Runs rarely (Palo Alto, Berlin)
- NOT mentioned on the EFM landing page
- EFM course content is derived from the FSF live event recordings

## Video Content Strategy
- Primary content: Edited recordings from FSF Palo Alto 2025 (5-day live event)
- Studio-recorded intros and outros added to each section for context
- Estimated ~5 hours of curated video content from the full 5-day event
- Exercises where Jonathan is giving instructions to the live audience will need context framing for self-paced learners
- Module structure to be determined by actual content (not pre-decided titles)

## Course Content (Based on FSF Palo Alto 2025 Transcript)

The FSF event spans 5 days with the following themes:

### Day 1: Connection & Foundation
- Welcome, check-in activities, name tags
- Week overview and rituals (presence, intentional connections, reflection, lean into your style, go all in)
- Icebreaker activities (interview your neighbor, draw your neighbor, Lego model of facilitation)
- **Core teaching:** Building psychological safety, the importance of connection before content

### Day 2: Collaboration & Decision Making (Jonathan leads)
- What is Emergent Facilitation? Why "Full-Stack"?
- The Practicality Offset concept
- The ECS Roadmap overview
- Why collaboration is broken (Bad Meeting Experience exercise)
- "None of the bad things about collaboration are going to change - you have to adapt"
- What most people think collaboration looks like vs reality
- Paper Tower Challenge (experiential learning about group dynamics)
- **Key Insight:** Collaboration is messy and it probably won't change. The role of a facilitator is to work WITH the messiness.
- **The 4 Principles of Facilitation:**
  1. Discussions are Sequenced (order matters)
  2. Discussions are Visualized (make thinking visible)
  3. We Work Alone Together (individual work in group settings)
  4. There's Always a Decision (workshops must end with clear decisions)
- How AJ&Smart runs meetings internally
- Group activities: "How Might We" exercise, group naming, Zombie Apocalypse scenario

### Day 3: Facilitation Mindset & Skills (Rebecca leads)
- Morning Pages exercise
- **Priming:** How to set the room and energy before a workshop
- **Facilitators as service people** (mindset shift)
- **The Facilitator's Mindset - 3 components:**
  1. **Optimism** - maintaining positive energy even when things go wrong
  2. **Adaptability** - flexibility when plans change
  3. **Awareness** - reading the room, noticing dynamics
- These three create **"Unshakeability"** - the core ECS mindset
- Don't gossip about your clients (professional tip)
- Q&A: Adapting to client requests, co-facilitator struggles

  1. Neutrality
  2. Creating an Inclusive Environment
  3. Questioning
  4. Managing Energy
  5. Active Listening
  6. Giving Clear Instructions

  - Different types of difficult participants
  - Role-play scenarios (groups of 3, each person plays facilitator, difficult participant, observer)

### Day 4: Workshop Design & The 4C's (Jonathan leads)
- Skills recap from Day 3
- The reality of meetings (why most are broken)
- **The 4C's Framework:**
  1. **Collect** - Gather challenges, ideas, data from the team
  2. **Choose** - Help the team prioritize what matters
  3. **Create** - Generate solutions people rally behind
  4. **Commit** - Turn solutions into action plans with owners
- Q&A: Showcasing 4C's to unfamiliar audiences, being facilitator AND participant, in-house vs freelance facilitators, Design Thinking fatigue
- **The Graph of How Facilitation Should Feel** (emotional arc of a workshop)
- **The 4 Core Activities:**

## Proposed EFM Module Structure (Based on Actual FSF Content)

These modules are derived from the teaching content in the FSF Palo Alto 2025 transcript. The structure follows the natural arc of the live event, reorganized for self-paced clarity.

### Module 1: The Core Insight (Why Facilitation Changes Everything)
*Source: Day 2, Videos 1-13*

**Key teaching:**
- Collaboration is inherently messy and will never change. Egos, politics, bad meetings, derailed agendas. These are features of human nature, not bugs at your specific company.
- The facilitator's job is not to "fix" collaboration but to work WITH the messiness. You're the person who makes things go better when you're in the room.
- What people think meetings look like (neat diamond model) vs. what actually happens (chaos, Slack, no decisions, spawn another meeting).
- The Paper Tower Challenge proof: even a room full of experienced facilitators falls apart without structure. Second graders outperform adults because they just start building instead of over-planning.
- **The reframe:** Companies pay designers $500K/year but those designers spend most of their time in pointless meetings. A facilitator unlocks hundreds of thousands of dollars of trapped human capability. This is why facilitators can charge $10K-$50K/day.
- "People support what they help create." Your role is getting people to feel ownership over decisions.

### Module 2: The 4 Principles (The Foundation of Every Session)
*Source: Day 2, Videos 14-19*

**Key teaching:**
1. **Discussions are Sequenced.** 80% of facilitation time is managing who speaks, when, for how long. The skill is developing a gut feeling for when to shift attention. This removes cognitive load so team members can actually think.
2. **Discussions are Visualized.** Build a real-time map of the conversation (walls, whiteboards, Miro). You write what YOU judge important, not everything. Prevents "recency bias" where only the last thing mentioned gets acted on.
3. **We Work Alone Together.** Participants work individually within group settings. Prevents groupthink. Gives introverts equal voice. Produces deeper, more original ideas. Clients are always shocked by this concept.
4. **There's Always a Decision.** Every session ends with clear next steps, priorities, and assigned owners. No more "let's schedule another meeting." This is the facilitator's biggest selling point.

**How AJ&Smart practices this:** Every single meeting at the company is facilitated. The meeting organizer either facilitates or assigns a facilitator. There is never a non-facilitated session.

### Module 3: The Facilitator's Mindset (Becoming Unshakeable)
*Source: Day 3, Videos 1-13*

**Key teaching:**
- **Priming:** Getting into the right state BEFORE the session. "State is more important than the script." Methods: morning pages/journaling, empathy playlists, walking the room, power poses, choosing one word for your desired state.
- **Facilitators are service people, not consultants or stars.** Direct parallel to hospitality: great waiters make mediocre restaurants feel amazing. AJ&Smart thinks of themselves as "below" the people they serve. "Be the guide, not the hero" extends to every detail.
- **The 3 Mindsets of an Unshakeable Facilitator:**
  1. **Optimism:** Emanating "we can get through this" even when things go sideways. Like flight attendants staying calm during turbulence. Your face is what the room reads for safety signals. When facilitators accidentally projected pessimism, sessions became 10x harder.
  2. **Adaptability:** The process serves the people, not the other way around. If senior leaders don't want to do breakout exercises, you adapt while still facilitating toward the same end goal. Even the FSF training itself was adapted in real time.
  3. **Awareness:** Noticing what's happening before it becomes a crisis. Someone checked out. A power dynamic shift. The team is exhausted. The key is having the information to adapt. Example: noticing yawns at 11:30 AM and suggesting an ice cream walk.
- These three create **Unshakeability**, the defining quality of an ECS-trained facilitator.
- **Attacks on Optimism** (what will test you): Frustration, tiredness, losing faith in the outcome, falling into content instead of facilitation, getting infected by negativity. These follow a predictable arc: worst at the start of a session, better toward the end.

### Module 4: The Core Skills (What Facilitators Actually Do)
*Source: Day 3, Videos 14-26*

**Key teaching:**
- **The Iceberg:** Clients see sticky notes and icebreakers. Underneath: connecting dots, active listening, managing rooms, creating safety, teaching, cheerleading, reading body language, providing "mental lubricant."
- **6 Core Skills every facilitator must develop:**
  1. **Neutrality:** Not imposing opinions or biases. Redirect questions to the group. Use anonymous methods. Reframe negatives as positives.
  2. **Creating an Inclusive Environment:** Ensuring all voices are heard, not just the loudest.
  3. **Questioning:** Open-ended vs. closed-ended transforms conversation quality. Closed questions make people feel "stunted, stuck, bored." Open questions make people feel "cared for, liberated, heard."
  4. **Managing Energy:** Reading and adjusting the room's energy level throughout a session.
  5. **Active Listening:** 5 tools: paraphrasing, questioning, mirroring, reflecting feeling, summarizing.
  6. **Giving Clear Instructions:** Tell people WHAT, HOW, and WHY. Show don't tell. Check comprehension. Progressive disclosure (reveal info as needed).
- **Dealing with 5 Types of Difficult Participants:**
  1. **The Interrupter:** "I'll come to you in two seconds." Gentle redirection + parking lot.
  2. **The Disengaged:** Give them a specific task. Compliment past contributions to draw them back.
  3. **The Late Comer:** Quick catch-up. Re-vote if needed.
  4. **The Dominator:** Time-boxing. Acknowledge then redirect. Pass the mic using body language cues.
  5. **The Skeptic:** Pre-interviews (capture canvas), clear expectations upfront, "Hopes and Fears" exercise.
- **The Parking Lot:** A visible space for important-but-off-topic ideas. Critical rule: if you say "we'll come back to that," you MUST follow up.
- **Social Contracts:** Co-create ground rules at the start. Get the potential troublemaker to sign it.

### Module 5: The 4C's Framework (The Structure Behind Every Workshop)
*Source: Day 4, Videos 1-12*

**Key teaching:**
- **The 4C's: Collect, Choose, Create, Commit.** Universal structure for any collaborative session, from 90 minutes to 5 days.
  1. **Collect:** Dump everything out. All challenges, ideas, tangents. No solutions yet. Just get it out of people's systems.
  2. **Choose:** From that dump, select what to focus on in THIS session. Off-topic items go to the parking lot.
  3. **Create:** Generate solutions individually and collectively for the chosen challenge.
  4. **Commit:** Assign tasks, owners, timelines. End with concrete next steps.
- **Why it works:** In normal meetings, people collect, choose, create, and commit simultaneously. Someone's campaigning for their pet project while someone else proposes solutions to a different problem. The 4C's separate these phases.
- **It's a mental map, not a rigid agenda.** As you improve, participants won't notice you're moving through phases. You can jump back from Create to Collect if needed. For clients: "morning is Collect and Choose, afternoon is Create and Commit."
- **The Graph of How Facilitation Should Feel:** Top-level facilitation follows a wave, not a checklist. Let chaos build, then gently bring the group back. Like meditation, gently returning to the breath without judgment. The worst facilitation is rigid exercise-to-exercise marching.
- **Different clients need different phase emphasis:** Silicon Valley startups need long Create phases. Corporate teams get the most value from Collect and Choose (political alignment).

### Module 6: The Toolkit (Exercises, Activities, and Recipes)
*Source: Day 4, Videos 13-23*

**Key teaching:**
- **The 4 Core Activities (the mechanical building blocks):**
  1. **Post-Up:** Collecting and displaying information (Post-Its, whiteboard, Miro, Google Doc).
  2. **Clustering / Affinity Mapping:** Grouping related items. Only when there's enough volume.
  3. **Voting:** Three types:
     - **Heat map voting:** Multiple dots, shows energy clusters, no winner/loser.
     - **Straw poll:** One dot each, simultaneous (countdown "3, 2, 1, vote" prevents contamination), shows group lean.
     - **Decider vote:** Designated decision-maker makes final call on ties.
  4. **Prioritization:** Creating visual hierarchy from voting results.
- **Workshop Recipes (pre-built session formats):**
  - Lightning Decision Jam (LDJ): 90-minute meeting replacement
  - Strategy Signal: 2-day strategic clarity workshop
  - Design Sprint: 5-day prototype and test cycle
  - Strategy Sprint: 3-week strategic alignment
- **Key insight: "You'll never run out of exercises. That won't be your bottleneck. The challenge will always be the mindset."**
- **Practical tips:** Give examples before asking participants to work. Same fat Sharpie for everyone (readable, concise). Progressive disclosure: don't reveal the full exercise framework before it's needed.

### Module 7: Building Your Facilitation Business
*Source: Various Q&A sections across all days + dedicated business content*

**Key teaching:**
- Pricing workshops at $5k-$15k+ (price decisions, not time or artifacts)
- The math: 6 workshops/year at $10k = $60k for 12 days work
- From order-taker to strategic partner positioning
- In-house facilitator vs. freelance: different advantages and approaches
- Finding ideal clients
- Writing proposals that close

3. **Flexibility over rigidity.** No one-size-fits-all approach. Works with Design Thinking, Agile, Lean, or whatever methodology your clients use.

4. **Business training included.** Modules 6 and 7 cover pricing ($5k-$15k workshops), client acquisition, proposals, and building a facilitation business. Most competitors skip this entirely.

5. **Based on 14 years of real workshops.** Not academic theory. Built from thousands of real sessions with real stakes at companies like Google, LEGO, and P&G.

6. **Community of 800+ practitioners (Pro).** Not learning in isolation. Weekly coaching calls and a private community of professional facilitators.
